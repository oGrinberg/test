Overview¶
k3d

What is k3d?¶
k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Lab’s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

Note: k3d is a community-driven project, that is supported by Rancher (SUSE) and it’s not an official Rancher (SUSE) product.

Learning¶
k3d demo repository: iwilltry42/k3d-demo

Featured use-cases include:

hot-reloading of code when developing on k3d (Python Flask App)
build-deploy-test cycle using Tilt
full cluster lifecycle for simple and multi-server clusters
Proof of Concept of using k3d as a service in Drone CI
Rancher Meetup - May 2020 - Simplifying Your Cloud-Native Development Workflow With K3s, K3c and K3d (YouTube)
Requirements¶
docker to be able to use k3d at all
Note: k3d v5.x.x requires at least Docker v20.10.5 (runc >= v1.0.0-rc93) to work properly (see #807)
kubectl to interact with the Kubernetes cluster

Quick Start¶
Create a cluster named mycluster with just a single server node:

bash k3d cluster create mycluster

Use the new cluster with kubectl, e.g.:

bash kubectl get nodes
